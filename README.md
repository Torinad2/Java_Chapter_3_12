Starting out with Java. Chapter 3, Assignment 12: The Speed of Sound.

The following table shows the approximate speed of sound in air, water, and steel:

Medium Speed

Air 1,100 feet per second

Water 4,900 feet per second

Steel 16,400 feet per second

Write a program that asks the user to enter “air”, “water”, or “steel”, and the distance that
a sound wave will travel in the medium. The program should then display the amount of
time it will take. You can calculate the amount of time it takes sound to travel in air with
the following formula:

Time = Distance/1,100

You can calculate the amount of time it takes sound to travel in water with the following
formula:

Time = Distance/4,900

You can calculate the amount of time it takes sound to travel in steel with the following
formula:

Time = Distance/16,400
